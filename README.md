Your mission is to recreate one of these three games that involve working with strings:
- [Wordle](https://wordplay.com/new)
- [Spelling Bee](https://spellingbeegame.org)
- [Type Racer](https://play.typeracer.com)

This project will be completed in phases. The first phase will be to work on this document. Use makrdown formatting. For more markdown help [click here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) or [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

All projects will require the following:
- A visual interface representative of the game. The entirety of the game should run in a window, not via the Processing console.
- Reading in text from a plain text file.
  - I will provide useful text files for the various games.
- The ability for users to start a new game without having to restart the program (either resetting after completing a round of the game, or allowing users to reset in the middle of a current game).
- Allowing text input via the keyboard.
- Some form of score/point system that is maintained while the program is running. (It does not need to keep track of score after the fact).

Wordle Specific Requirements:
- Gameplay should follow Wordle rules. The coloring of the squares should work the same way it does for Wordle (play a few rounds to understand th specifics surrounding duplicate letters).

Spelling Bee specific requirements:
- Users should be able to see the words they have already entered.

Type Racer specific requirements.
- There should be a visual indication of how are along the user is (similar to the cars in type racer).
- This should only be a 1-player game, even if you add other features.
